# Project Submission for SIH 2022 
Demo code for SIH 2020 submission. An app(SaaS) to remotely manage all the worker computers on a workstation from the Admin computers.

**Problem Statement :** To track list of software installed in the PC’s / Workstation’s attached to the network. \
**PS Code :** GR917 \
**Team Name :** Space_Defer. 

## Setup and run instructions 
To run this code locally, clone this repository and you can start *coordinator* or *worker* using following commands:

Please make sure that the coordinator and worker are connected on the same network(LAN).

To run coordinator :
```
go run main.go --mode coordinator
```

To run worker : 
```

```

Once the coordinator and worker processes are running, the coordinator will send heartbeats to the workers every 10 seconds and gets a list of all the 
installed apps on the PC using RPCs.
